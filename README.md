# DS-5220 Principles of Programming Course Outline

GH Course page for DS5220 Principles of Programming and Simulation

## Course Description
- Students learn the foundations of effective programming practice, how to program and evaluate a
simulation, and how to apply modern resampling techniques in simulations in both R and Python. Students learn workflow solutions, e.g., Jupyter Notebooks, R Markdown reports, and collaboration platforms (e.g., GitHub and version control). Reproducible methods for programming and data processing are emphasized.

## COVID Policy
- Refer to: [COVID-19 Health and Safety](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/)

## Class Format: 
- The class is in-person only. No zoom recording should be expected. If you miss class, connect with the TA or a peer or come to office hours to catch up. We will use Slack during the lecture to enhance interactions.

## Class (location: Sony Building 2001-A):

**Lecture:** Tuesday and Thursday: 03:15 – 04:30 pm

**Office Hour:** Tuesday and Thursday: 04:30 – 05:30 pm 

## Course Materials:
- All course materials including lecture notes, homework assignments, grades, and announcements can be found on Github.

## Homework:
- Receive your homework assignments from Github Classroom.
- Regular homework: direct application of R/Python programming skills discussed in the lecture 
- Extra homework: more applications of R/Python programming skills in solving real life problems

_Revision policy for the extra homework (not regular homework): if your homework receives <70% of the full credit, you are given one opportunity to revise the homework and ask the TA (i.e., Rio) for “regrading”. The maximum score resulted from the “regrading” is 70% of the full credit. The revision policy can only be applied within 72 hours after you receive the score. Please contact the TA (i.e., Rio) if you have special circumstances and want to ask for extension._

## Exams:
- Both the mid-term exam and the final will take the form of projects. The exam will cover the concepts of quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical simulations. If you have any conflicts with the dates of the mid-term, you must notify the instructor at least two weeks before the exam. 

## Mid-term/Final Grade Appeal Policy: 
- The instructor is willing to revisit a grade only in the instance of suspected error. Do not request an appeal based on a disagreement with the instructor’s judgment. If you disagree with a grade that you’ve received on an assignment or project, then you are welcome to submit an appeal to Dr. Yang in email (zhongyue.yang@vanderbilt.edu). The appeal should be submitted via email and must include: (1) clear and specific reference to the part of the assignment or project in question and (2) justification for why more credit is earned, citing specific material or evidence. The appeal should be no later than 7 days after the grade has been posted on Brightspace. If, after the appeal you still have concerns, you should raise them with the DGS or Associate DGS.

## Grading: 
- 10% participation (attend the lecture or the project track)
- 20% regular homework 
- 20% extra homework
- 20% midterm project
- 30% final project
- Additional +1% with the completion of the "Project Track"

## Grade Scale: 
- A-:[90,93) A:[93,100)
- B-:[80,83) B:[83,87) B+:[87,90)
- C-:[70,73) C:[73,77) C+:[77,80)
- D:[60,70)
- F:[0,60)

_Note: You will have the opportunity to drop one homework/short assignment. To receive credit, assignments must be submitted by the deadline (see the Time schedule section below)._

## Special Arrangement:
- Sep. 22nd (Dr. Spencer-Smith)
- Nov. 3rd (TBD)

**Note on the Honour Code:**
- All exams and homework assignments are on the Vanderbilt Honour System. You are permitted and encouraged to work in groups to work out the answers to the suggested problems; this is not a violation of the Honour Code. But, graded homework problems and exams should be answered without any outside help. A full description of the Honour Code is provided in the Vanderbilt University Student Handbook.
